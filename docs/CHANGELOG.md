## Key Changes Made

### Code Quality & Refactoring Updates (June 2025)
- **Training Function Refactoring**: Major cognitive complexity reduction in `crackernaut_train.py`
  - `bulk_train_on_wordlist()`: Complexity reduced from 39 → <15
  - `interactive_training()`: Complexity reduced from 23 → <15
- **Helper Function Extraction**: Decomposed complex training workflows into focused, testable functions
- **Improved Maintainability**: Enhanced code organization following SOLID principles
- **Better Error Handling**: More granular error handling in individual training components

### Technology Stack Updates
- **Package Manager**: All references updated to use `uv` instead of pip
- **PyTorch**: Updated to specify CUDA 12.1 support with +cu121 wheels
- **GPU Requirements**: Specified RTX 3090 compatibility and CUDA 12.1+
- **Installation**: Updated all installation commands to use uv

### Installation Process
- Base installation: `uv sync`
- CUDA installation: `uv sync --extra cuda`
- Development dependencies: `uv sync --extra dev`
- All extras: `uv sync --all-extras`

### Verification Commands
- GPU check: `uv run python scripts/check_gpu.py`
- CUDA test: `uv run python simple_cuda_test.py`
- PyTorch verification: `uv run python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`

### Configuration
- Updated pyproject.toml with PyTorch CUDA index configuration
- Added [tool.uv] and [tool.uv.sources] sections
- Specified exact CUDA versions for torch, torchvision, torchaudio

## Consistency Verification

✅ All documentation files use consistent uv commands
✅ All files reference CUDA 12.1 correctly
✅ No legacy pip or virtualenv references remain
✅ Hardware requirements are consistent across all files
✅ Installation instructions are standardized
✅ VS Code tasks are properly documented

## Current Status

All documentation is now fully up-to-date and consistent with the current:
- PyTorch 2.5.1+cu121 installation
- CUDA 12.1 support
- uv package management
- RTX 3090 GPU configuration
- VS Code development environment
- **NEW**: Refactored training code with reduced cognitive complexity

## Recent Documentation Updates (June 2025)

### Training Code Refactoring Documentation
- **STRUCTURE.md**: Added comprehensive section on code quality improvements with detailed helper function extraction
- **AGENTS.md**: Enhanced ML Training Agent section with refactoring details and improved capabilities
- **README.md**: Expanded Recent Updates section with specific extracted helper functions
- **COPILOT_SETUP.md**: Added note about enhanced code quality and maintainability improvements
- **DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md**: Updated to include refactoring documentation changes

### Key Refactoring Highlights Documented
- Cognitive complexity reduction: `bulk_train_on_wordlist` (39→<15), `interactive_training` (23→<15)
- Helper function extraction improving modularity, testability, and maintainability
- Enhanced error handling and code organization following SOLID principles
- Streamlined training workflows with dedicated, focused functions

## Next Steps

The documentation is complete and ready for use. All developers should now be able to:
1. Set up the environment using the updated instructions
2. Verify CUDA/PyTorch installation
3. Use the provided VS Code tasks
4. Follow the development workflow as documented
