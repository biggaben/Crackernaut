# Crackernaut now uses uv for dependency management.
# Please use one of the following instead:
#
#   uv sync                    # Install basic dependencies
#   uv sync --extra cuda      # Install with CUDA support
#   uv sync --extra dev       # Install development tools
#   uv sync --all-extras      # Install everything
#
# For migration help, run: uv run python migrate_to_uv.py
# Or use the setup scripts: .\setup.ps1 (Windows) or ./setup.sh (Unix)
#
# These pip requirements are automatically managed by pyproject.toml:

numpy
tqdm
pycuda
ax-platform
python-Levenshtein
torch
aiofiles
scikit-learn
